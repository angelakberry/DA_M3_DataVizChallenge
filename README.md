# ☕ Data Visualization Ethics Challenge

This repository contains a fictional coffee chain sales dataset and a starter Jupyter Notebook for the **Data Visualization Ethics Challenge**.

## 📌 Overview
In this challenge, you’ll practice applying ethical design principles by fixing **two intentionally bad charts**.  
The goal is to identify misleading or unclear design choices and create clear, accurate, and honest visualizations that follow best practices.

You will:
1. **Identify** problems with each bad chart.
2. **Redesign** them to follow ethical visualization guidelines.
3. **Document** your changes and explain why they improve the chart.

## ✅ Best Practices Reminder
When redesigning your charts:
- Use the correct variables for the message you want to communicate.
- Start the y-axis at zero unless you have a transparent reason not to.
- Use neutral colors unless highlighting a legitimate difference.
- Add clear axis labels, a descriptive (neutral) title, and the data source.
- Avoid “chartjunk” - unnecessary 3D effects, heavy gridlines, or distracting colors.
- Always provide context and avoid misleading design choices.

**Have fun, and remember:** *Good charts tell the truth.*
